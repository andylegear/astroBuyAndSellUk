## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection

### Installation
1. Download or clone the project files
2. Open `buyandselluk.html` in your web browser
3. The application will automatically start loading listings

### CORS Considerations
Due to browser security restrictions, the application uses CORS proxies to fetch data from the original website. If you encounter loading issues:

1. **Try a different proxy**: The app automatically tries multiple proxy services
2. **Use a CORS browser extension**: Install a CORS extension for your browser
3. **Disable browser security** (not recommended): Run browser with `--disable-web-security` flag

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to load listings" error:**
- Check internet connection

- Try refreshing to use cached data

**Missing listings:**
